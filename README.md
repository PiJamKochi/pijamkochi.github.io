# Raspberry Pi Jam Kochi 


Raspberry Jams are independently organised community events where people get together to share knowledge, learn new things, and meet other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. Attending a Jam is a great way to find out more about the Raspberry Pi and Open Hardware, learn what you can do with it, and meet like-minded people.
